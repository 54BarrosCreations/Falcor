//  The Test works as follows:
//  Based on the values in Count, Constant Buffers, Texture Buffers, Samplers, Textures, Raw Buffers and Structured Buffers are all created.
//  Then based on the values in declarations, the resources are declared in each of the shader stages. 
//  Setting the "invalid" value to true indicates that the generated set of resources and assignment should be invalid.
//  An invalid setting can be achieved by redefining resources in the same or different shader stages, or by trying to make two resources have overlapping indexing.
